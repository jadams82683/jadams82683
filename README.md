Hello everyone! Thanks for checking out my profile. I got into the world of programming and tech later in life but am awfully glad I did though. I began as a professional pianist and while music is still a passion, I realized that it's not my only passion and definitely not something I want to continue doing to make a living. I finally pulled the trigger on enrolling for courses at Coding Dojo bootcamp in 2021 and it was absolutely one of the best decisions I've ever made - I only wish I did it sooner! In addition to learning Web Fundamentals, Python, Java, and the MERN stack, I also developed invaluable experience in developing my critical thinking and problem-solving skills while there. I was fortunate to be able to do an internship shortly after graduation where I acquired real-world experience using C#, Typescript, and the Angular framework. I love learning new languages and technologies and refining my skills in previously learned ones.
